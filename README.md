# Node-Passport-Boilerplate
A simple NodeJS boilerplate that demonstrates how to authenticate users against a local database. Will cover Facebook's OAuth in a future release.  I used a MySQL Relational Database because I prefer it over MongoDB, but you can use any type of database with this project, be it either relational or NoSQL.
